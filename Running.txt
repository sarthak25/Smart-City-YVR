Instructions Explanation:

IMPORTANT : Please Trust the Notebooks so that you are able to see all the graphs and outputs.

(Once all the Prerequisites are met, now you are ready to review the project:) 

1. Download the Jupyter Notebooks 
Housing Data.ipynb
Energy Data.ipynb
Transpotation Analytics.ipynb
Transpotation Visualization.ipynb

2. If you want to execute each command by your own, Please follow download Dataset : Download the files from github

3. Once you have all the files along with Jupyter Notebooks, you will be able to run all the results one by one and by this you can look all the processing and outputs happening.
